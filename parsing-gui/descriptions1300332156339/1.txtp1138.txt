Unisexual trees, often tall with relatively slender smooth trunks, independent or (?) rarely epiphytic; the sap clear but quickly becoming dark in color, not milky; stipules connate and (consequently) solitary, enclosing the stem-apex and leaving a scar encircling the stem, usually large. Leaves simple and alternate in a spiral, petiolate and basifixed, the lamina entire to deeply lobed (entire and narrowly ellip-tic in juvenile stages), pinnately or palmately veined, tertiary veins subparallel, often pale-grayish tomentose beneath. Inflorescences unisexual, usually paired in the axils of the current leaves, peduncle usually branched with the flowers in cymose clusters or rarely unbranched and the flowers umbellate. Male flowers usually in congested clusters or capitate, sessile on the branches of the inflorescence; perianth of 3 or 4 parts or lobes, stamens 3 or 4, filaments erect, free or connate at the base. Female flowers sessile or more often pedicellate, perianth tubular with a small open-ing at the apex, enclosing ovary and style and persisting in fruit, stigma simple, papilla te-puberulent, peltate-discoid, ovule borne on the wall of the locule near the base by adnation of the funicle. Fruit moderately large (1-3 cm.), tightly enclosed within the persisting slightly succulent perianth.
