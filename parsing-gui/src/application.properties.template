application.instructions=Start from General, go through each tab (i.e. step) to complete the parsing process of a volume of\r\nFNA. \
Save configuration information entered on General tab so next time it can be simply loaded.\r\nTo continue work from the tab where you\
 left last time, load configuration information and jump \r\n the tab. Repeatedly run Verification until there is no error reported\
  before proceeding to\r\nTransformation. It's good to do so for other steps that need expert intervention.

step1DescpPart1=This step segments a volume to individual treatments. Use 'File Link' to open a file for review. If segmentation errors are spotted (only happens rarely), correct segmentations in ProjectFolder/target/extracted
step1DescpPart2=  folder (no rerun is needed). If content errors are spotted, make corrections in ProjectFolder/source/document.xml 
step1DescpPart3= and rerun this step by clicking 'Clear & Rerun'. 
step2DescpPart1=This step verifies the results of step 1. If an error is reported here, correct it by editing the file in ProjectFolder/target/extracted
step2DescpPart2=. Use 'File Link' to open a file for editing. Rerun this step by clicking on 'Clear & Rerun' repeatedly until no error is reported.
step3DescpText=This step produces metadata annotation. Use 'File Link' to open a file for review and edit. Save corrected files to ProjectFolder/target/transformed.
step4Descp=This step produces sentence level annotation and identifies structure names and character descriptors. Use the sub-tabs to review and categorize terms. Save the final categorization by clicking the 'Save' button on EACH subtab. \n\nClick Run button to run the Perl program to extract terms. When it is completed, you will see a message "Done" in the message box below.
step4Descp1=Structures = organs/parts (including "midline" of ..., the "connection" between ... ) in noun (e.g., anus) or adjective (e.g., anal) forms, taxon names, pronouns referring to any of the above. 
step4Descp2=Descriptors = character state terms (including adjectives and intransitive verbs used in this sense). 
step4Descp3=Neither = Prepositions, transitive verbs, adverbs, and other terms that doesn't describe a character directly (e.g.,"general", "ditto", "leave" the "freedom" for ...).
step4Descp1.simple=Click on 'Load Task' to start. CharaParser categorized these terms as structure terms. Please review/edit the categorization of the terms. Please treat "ditto" and general living habit and life style terms (e.g., "annuals") as structures. 
step4Descp2.simple=Click on 'Load Task' to start. CharaParser categorized these terms as character terms. Please review/edit the categorization of the terms. Please note transitive verbs are not characters. 
step4Descp3.simple=Click on 'Load Task' to start. Please categorize these terms for CharaParser. 
step4Descp1.old=Click on 'Load Task' to start. Select all non-structure terms, then click 'Mark as Bad'. Then click 'Mark Others as Good'. Then click 'Save Decisions'. Treat "ditto" and general living habit and life style terms (e.g., annuals) as structure terms.
step4Descp2.old=Click on 'Load Task' to start. Select all non-descriptor terms, then click 'Mark as Bad'. Then click 'Mark Others as Good'. Then click 'Save Decisions'. Treat verbs as non-descriptors.
step4Descp3.old=Click on 'Load Task' to start. Select all structure terms, then click 'Mark as Good'. Then click 'Mark Others as Bad'. Then click 'Save Decisions'. Treat "ditto" and general living habit and life style terms (e.g., annuals) as structure terms. 
step4Descp4.old=Click on 'Load Task' to start. Select all descriptor terms, then click 'Mark as Good'. Then click 'Mark Others as Bad'. Then click 'Save Decisions'. Treat verbs as non-descriptors.   
#step5Descp=This step allows you to load sentences for manual markup. Click on Load Task to start. Select a sentence and then select/enter appropriate modifier and tag for the sentence. Click 'Apply to Checked' to update the sentence table shown. Use "ignore" to tag non-morphological description sentences. 'Save Tagged Sentences' to save your work.    
step5Descp=This step prepares the system for the next step. Click on Run to start.
step6DescpText=Here are the terms whose category is unknown to the parser. They are presented to you by group. Please go through these groups one by one to give them a good category label. You may remove terms from a group by clicking the "x" next to a term.  
step7DescpText=This step outputs final annotated files. Use 'File Link' to open a file for review and edit. Save corrected files to ProjectFolder/target/final.
