Trees or rarely large shrubs; buttresses moderate to well developed; bark ex-foliating or tight, surface reddish-brown, interior bright orange to yellow-orange; wood white throughout or heartwood sometimes pink, fine, straight grained; buds studded with yellow peltate scales, without hairs. Leaves occasionally puberulent in young shoots but glabrous at maturity, mainly decussate, occasionally alternate; petioles short to long; leaflets 4-12, generally long petiolulate, mainly entire, or serrate on young plants and sucker shoots. Inflorescences borne terminally with flush of new growth of yellow-red or pink leaves, or occasionally terminal on axillary shoots of old wood; female and male inflorescences either separate, or combined in androgynous panicles with central female catkin flanked by 1-6 male catkins. Male flowers numerous, alternately arranged, sessile or essentially so, compact or elon-gate, floral segments 4-6, flat or hooded; stamens 8(9) in one series, or 16-19 stamens in two series. Pollen tripororate (2-8), isopolar, suboblate-oblate; amb triangular to rounded-triangular, 20-26 /u,m in diameter; pores circular; nexine thick, from one-third to equalling tectum in thickness. Female flowers numerous, alternately arranged, sessile or nearly so; bract-bracteolar floral cup forms a pedes-tal with 3-lobed bract abaxial, bracteolar rim adaxial, calyx tube fused to floral cup at base, forming distinct tube above; sepal lobes 4, narrow or broad, extending to summit of stigma or beyond, reflexed at time of pollination, or arched to form sheltered chamber; style short or long-tapering, bifurcate with deep clett separating stylar arms; stigma weakly 4-parted, horseshoe shaped, carinal, verrucose stigmatic surface confined to rim and outer surface. Fruit medium to large, 3-winged; adaxial bracteolar lobe covering nut at maturity; nut small, globose, 8-chambered at equator; husk essentially obsolete; shell cartilaginous. Seedling with hypogeous cotyledons; first two aerial leaves opposite and simple or compound, with leaves or leaflets entire or serrate. Chromosome number JV=16.
