Trees or rarely large shrubs; bark tight, or with small chips exfoliating, surface reddish-brown with congested lenticels, interior of bark pink with white streaks or orange-yellow ; sap wood white, heartwood pink, fine, straight grained ; buds glabrous or pubescent. Leaves glabrous or pubescent, decussate, occasionally whorled, infrequently alternate; petioles short to long; leaflets 6-18(30), sessile to short petiolulate, margins entire, or serrate on young plants and sucker shoots. Inflor-escences borne terminally with flush of new growth of pink leaves, or occasionally terminal on axillary shoots of old wood; female and male inflorescences either separate and terminal, or combined into an androgynous panicle with central female catkin flanked by one or more pairs of male catkins, or rarely with central male catkin subtended by female flowers. Male flowers numerous, alternately arranged, compact or elongate; floral segments 4-7, flat or hooded; stamens 6-12 in one series. Pollen tripororate (2-8), isopolar, suboblate-oblate; amb triangular to rounded triangular, 20 -2 6 /mm in diameter, pores circular, nexine thick, from one-third to equalling tectum in thickness. Female flowers numerous, alternately arranged; floral cup sometimes elongated into a pedestal consisting of a 3-lobed abaxial bract and an adaxial bracteolar rim; calyx tube fused to floral cup at base, distinct above, 4 broad sepal lobes reflexed at time of pollination to expose stigma, or arched to form sheltered chamber; style obsolete to long tapering, bifurcate with shallow to deep cleft separating stylar arms; stigma weakly 4-parted, horseshoe shaped, carinal, verrucose stigmatic surface confined to rim and outer surface. Fruit medium to large drupaceous nut, ellipsoid to obloid, without wings, 8-chambered at equator; calyx and style persistent at apex; bract-bracteoles persisting as a small to large circular tab at base; husk leathery or hard, indehiscent, sometimes with pronounced corrugations; shell brittle to hard. Seedling with hypogeous cotyledons; first two aerial leaves alternate or opposite, simple or compound, leaves and leaflets entire or serrate. Chromosome number n= 16.
