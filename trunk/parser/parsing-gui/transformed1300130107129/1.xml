  <nonMorph pid="1.txtp3">A small family of five genera and about 50 species in the tropics and subtropics. The family is of phylogenetic interest because it contains one of the very few woody angiosperm genera lacking vessels in the xylem, Sarcandra of Southeast Asia. Hedyosmum is the only genus of the family native to the Americas. The female flowers of Hedyosmum mexicanum have recently been studied by Peter Endress (Bot. Jahrb. 91:39-60. 1971), who interprets the ovary to be monocarpic and compares the family with woody fami-lies of the ranalian alliance.</nonMorph>

  <nonMorph pid="1.txtp5">Bisexual or unisexual trees or shrubs, branches articulate at the nodes and exuding a gelatinous aromatic exudate when cut. Leaves evergreen, petioles grooved above and vaginate at the base with the adaxial margins united with those of the opposing leaf to form a tube sheathing the stem, with or without small stipule-like structures on the distal margin of the sheath; laminae generally elliptic and serrate, the serrations often with whitish tissue forming a disc-like gland near their apex (probably a hydathode), venation pinnate. Inflorescences terminal or axillary, sometimes united with the stem near the base, the individual inflorescence uni-sexual but the compound inflorescences often with female flowers above and male flowers on lower branches; male inflorescence of one to several spikes elongating at anthesis, the male flower without a perianth or subtending bracts, each flower repre-sented by a solitary stamen, filament absent or very short, connective usually pro-duced beyond the two thecae; female inflorescence spicate, thyrse-like, or capitate, female flowers subtended by bracts, the perianth tubular and 3-lobed, adnate to the ovary and enlarging in fruit, stigma sessile or subsessile on a very short style, deciduous. Fruit drupe-like with the fleshy wall formed by the accrescent perianth in part, ellipsoid to globose or ovoid, usually trigonous, exocarp juicy, the 3 minute perianth lobes often persisting and whitish at the apex of the fruit.</nonMorph>
  <nonMorph pid="1.txtp6">A genus with probably fewer than 30 species in the Neotropics and with a single species in southeastern Asia. The genus is primar-ily South American with several species in the West Indies and only one species reaching Mexico. The male flowers are perhaps the most reduced among angiosperms, lacking bracts and perianth, and represented by a single, almost sessile, anther. The expanded con-nective, usually broad and flat above, serves to protect the repro-ductive parts in early stages before expansion of the spike. Except for Hedyosmum mexicanum, our species are here interpreted as having rather narrow ecological limits. I believe that our collections are sufficiently large to indicate that these narrow patterns of dis-tribution are real and not merely artifacts of inadequate sampling. Our species are found only in areas that are quite moist throughout the year. No Costa Rican species is known to grow in the flat Carib-bean Coastal Plain; all species here appear to require the drainage of hilly sites.</nonMorph>

  <nonMorph pid="1.txtp37">Specimens placed here were previously thought to be H. calloso-serratum, but the latter species has solitary female flowers and is separated, in Costa Rica, from H. montanum by an altitudinal dis-junction of about 800 m. I beb'eve that we have enough material to indicate that this ecological separation is real and not an artifact of poor sampling. Hedyosmum montanum is also closely related to H. scaberrimum, which differs in anther-size and lower elevation habitat. The lack of intermediates between these entities and a very consistent correlation between their morphology and habitat lead me to believe that these taxa are better treated as species than as subspecies or varieties. The material that I have seen from Nicaragua and have mentioned above (Friedrichsthal 1031, Grant 795 &amp;811) differs slightly in morphology from material placed here and occurs in a rather different habitat. Hedyosmum montanum has not been collected in the Cordillera de Guanacaste, where one might expect to find intermediates (if such exist) with the Nicaraguan material.

Diels, in reworking Engler's Syllabus der Pflanzenfamilien (llth edition, 1936), considered the plants placed here as no more than a tribe within the Flacourtiaceae. A superficial examination of the flowers of our species of Lozania leads me to concur with the view that these plants belong with the Flacourtiaceae. Even in the absence of flowers and fruit, the dried leaves and stems of Lozania bear a striking resemblance to herbarium material of Casearia and other members of the Flacourtiaceae. Our species of Lacistema, with its short spikes (aments) with minute flowers largely hidden by the imbricate bracts, appears to be very different from most Flacourtiaceae, but it is clearly related through Lozania.</nonMorph>

Populations are known from near sea-level along the Caribbean coast from Nicaragua northward, but it is apparently an uncommon occurrence and the material that I have seen lacks flowers and fruit.

With the variation and range ascribed to M. cerifera, it may seem inconsistent to consider these closely related taxa as separate species. In the case of M. phanerodonta, the plants are easily separable ecologically and morphologically with no real evi-dence of intergradation. However, the situation with M. tindeniana is not as clear. Material referable to M. lindeniana occurs through-out much of the range of M. cerifera in Central America and appears to grow in moister situations and at higher altitudes. Typical material of M. lindeniana has conspicuously longer (6-12 cm.) laminae than M. cerifera with more numerous (9-16 pairs) and more prominent secondary veins and serrations. The ecological and morphological distinctions are bridged by some collections that appear to be intermediate, but these collections are few in number and may prove to be unusual variants rather than true inter-mediates. Because there is a correlation between ecology and morphology, and until the species are actually studied in the field, I prefer to treat them as separate.

It is very closely related toM. lindeniana C.DC. but differs in its usually much shorter leaves and the apparent lack of intermediates with typical M. cerifera. I believe that this species has become differ-entiated fromM. cerifera (sensu lato) in a way that is more complete than but very similar to the differentiation of M. lindeniana ; both are adapted to higher elevations and both possess serrulate leaves with rather conspicuous venation. A similar situation may exist in Colombia, where several taxa are found that are closely related to M. cerifera (sensu lato) but that differ in their smaller leaves and high-altitude habitats.</nonMorph>

  <nonMorph pid="1.txtp118">The family of seven genera and approximately 60 species is con-centrated in the temperate regions of Asia and North America, but extends southward into the montane areas of southeastern Asia, Central and South America, and the West Indies. Members of the Juglandaceae have a well-marked Tertiary history (Berry, 1912), and there is good evidence that several of the genera now confined to Asia were well represented in North America and Europe prior to the Pleistocene (Nichols, 1973). Three genera (Engelhardia, Platycarya, Pterocarya) are extant in the Old World. The Costa Rican representatives of Alfaroa and Oreomunnea are strictly tropical American elements, whereas the hickories (Carya) and walnuts (Juglans) have a north temperate concentration in the Americas and Asia. The 13 New World species of Carya extend only as far south as the State of Veracruz in Mexico. Juglans, on the other hand, is distributed more or less continuously from Canada south through the West Indies and Central America to Argentina (Manning, 1957a, 1960a), but is conspicuous by its absence from Costa Rica and Panama. Juglans boliviano, (C.DC.) Dode was intro-duced into cultivation at the Institute Interamericano de Ciencias Agricolas (IICA) in Turrialba in 1948 (Manning, 1957b), and more recently was established successfully in San Jose. Evidence from fossil walnuts from Ecuador suggests that the southward migra-tion reached South America only in late Neogene time (Brown, 1946).</nonMorph>
  <nonMorph pid="1.txtp119">The family is coherent and natural with a striking similarity in vegetative characters (de Candolle, 1862), including peltate scales and pinnately compound, estipulate leaves, and a diversity of floral and fruiting features (Manning, 1938, 1941, 1948) that are readily interpretable in terms of evolutionary shifts in the mode of pollination ( Whitehead 1969), and seed dispersal and establishment (Conde and Stone, 1970; Stone, 1970, 1973). The monotypic Rhoipteleaceae from China appears to be a primitive member of the Juglandales (Cronquist, 1968; Stone and Broome, 1971; Takhtajan, 1969; Withner, 1941). Recent suggestions (Hutchinson, 1959; Cronquist, 1968) of close affinity with the Picrodendraceae are unfounded (Stone, 1973), though Thome's placement of the two families near the Anacardiaceae-Burseraceae-Sapindaceae (Rutales of Thome, 1973; Sapindales of Cronquist, 1968) seems to be gaining acceptance (Stebbins, 1974; Wolfe, 1973).</nonMorph>
  <nonMorph pid="1.txtp120">Costa Rica is the center of species diversity for the two native genera. Four of the six species of Alfaroa and the two species of Oreomunnea grow within a 50 km. radius of San Jose. Cartago Province, the type locality for both genera, has the richest concen-tration of species. The possibility of finding new species of Juglan-daceae is certainly good. The disjunct mountain tops and isolated valleys provide many suitable habitats for local endemism. Costa Rica should be a haven for alpha and omega taxonomists for many years to come. This is particularly true insofar as both genera have had such special significance in interpretation of the phylogeny of the family, because of their possession of a host of primitive fea-tures: long vessel members and occasional presence of scalariform perforations (Heimsch and Wetmore, 1939); terminal androgynous panicles (Manning, 1938); and small pollen grains that are basically tripororate, isopolar, suboblate in equatorial view, and sub-triangular in polar view (Whitehead, 1965; Stone and Broome, 1975).</nonMorph>

  <nonMorph pid="1.txtp141">Four Costa Rican species of Alfaroa are recognized, including one new species (A. guanacastensis) and subspecies (A. williamsii subsp. tapantiensis). A. costaricensis, which is the most distinctive member of the genus, has the widest range, extending from Mexico to Panama. It is sympatric in Costa Rica with the closely related A. williamsii. A. williamsii Molina subsp. williamsii is the only species of Alfaroa reported from Nicaragua. In addition, Alfaroas are known from Mexico (A mexicana Stone), Guatemala [A. guatemalensis (Standley) Williams], and Honduras (A. hondurensis Williams). A single immature specimen from Colombia (Killip &amp; Smith 19285) was tentatively identified by Manning (1959) as A. manningii. However, the surface of the fruit is not deeply cor-rugated and ridged as that of A. manningii, and it seems likely that the South American collection represents a new, undescribed species.</nonMorph>
  <nonMorph pid="1.txtp142">The species of Alfaroa in Costa Rica are trees of mid-elevations occurring in the premontane rainforests that extend from the borders of Nicaragua to Panama. Their disjunct distribution coin-cides with the many volcanoes and well-defined mountain ranges in northwest and central Costa Rica. The trees are often locally abun-dant, and they are readily recognized in the growing season by flushes of pink or dull red shoots. Locating Alfaroas in virgin rain-forest is aided considerably by the distinctive saplings in the under-story. The leaves are even-pinnate and at first are alternately arranged, but the later formed leaves have a distinctive decussate phyllotaxy. During the growing season the central leader displays a terminal apex with golden-yellow buds flanked by a pair of reddish young leaves with conduplicate leaflets. The adult trees are charac-terized by moderate size buttresses, tight bark with congested lenticels, generally pink interior, and fine grained wood that is white to pink. The lumber is of cabinet quality, so this is often one of the first species to be logged when new roads are opened. The flowers are inconspicuous in the field, though a thorough search of the litter often uncovers dried remains of male catkins. The fruits are walnut-like with a thin or thick fibrous husk and a cartilaginous to hard shell. The fruits are similar to those of Oreomunnea in having a distinctive 8-chambered nut.</nonMorph>
  <nonMorph pid="1.txtp143">The Costa Rican species of Alfaroa fall into two groups: (1) A. costaricensis and A. williamsii subsp. tapantiensis leaflets entire or serrate, the first pair of aerial seedling leaves opposite, pinnately compound, and leaflets serrate, young leaflets conduplicate at first but flattening out in primoidal stage (leaflet less than 1.5 mm. wide); (2) A. guanacastensis and A. manningii leaflets always entire, the first pair of aerial seedling leaves alternate, or opposite and simple or compound, young leaflets conduplicate throughout early stages of leaf expansion (leaflet over 10 mm. wide). There is probably sufficient additional evidence to recognize these groups formally, but I am postponing a decision on this matter until more collections are available.</nonMorph>

Trees from "La Palma de San Ramon," Alajuela, were sampled in 1928 (Brenes 6300) and again in 1966 (Stone 2326). Most of the area around San Ramon has been converted to pasture and farmland for sugarcane. Only two remnant trees were located on a windswept ridge-top about 10 km. north of the city. Records by Skutch from Heredia (Skutch 4684, 4686) have been confirmed by repeated visits to Vara Blanca from 1967 (Stone 21 73) through 1975 (Stone 3621). The trees are scattered in broken pastures and virgin forest at approximately 1700 m. elevation. The record from San Jose Province was first recorded by Stork 1 700 from Santa Maria de Dota. I relocated a few trees south of the city in 1968 (Stone 2679) on a steep mountain ridge above a pasture broken with oaks, dogwoods, and tree ferns. The report from Guanacaste is based on my 1972 collection (Stone 3383) from the exquisite cloud forest near the Quaker community at Monteverde. Some of the largest trees that I have seen once formed stately groves in the mountains south of Muneco in Cartago Province, but extensive logging in the past several years has reduced the population considerably.</nonMorph>

  <nonMorph pid="1.txtp149">Alfaroa costaricensis is the most distinctive member of the genus. The Mexican and Guatemalan trees tend to have longer petiolules and a somewhat less truncate leaflet than the Costa Rican and Panamanian specimens, but the taxon is easily identified by its highly reduced petiole and lower leaflets, and the pubescent stems, leaves, and fruits. This species is most closely related to A. williamsii. Plants of both taxa produce at least some leaflets with toothed margins. The first pair of aerial leaves of the seedlings are normally opposite and pinnately compound with coarsely serrate leaflets. The male and female flowers also have much in common, though there are subtle, distinctive differences. A. costaricensis has a short to long pedicel supporting the male flower, and the female flower is hirsuite. A. williamsii has staminate flowers with an extremely short pedicel; the female flowers are covered with peltate scales but are without hairs. The two species also have several distinctive vegetative differences. The former has a pubes-cent petiole and rachis, an extremely short petiole, and leaflets that are mainly truncate at the base, whereas the latter is glabrous throughout, the petiole is relatively long, and the leaflets are mainly obtuse at the base. Intermediates between these species have been collected. Hybridization, which is suspected, is discussed under A. williamsii.</nonMorph>

The seedlings were at first thought to be highly distinctive in the Miravalles population. The first aerial leaves are uniformly opposite and compound, a condition previously encountered only in A. cos-taricensis and A. williamsii, although the latter two have serrate instead of entire leaflets. The single seedling from Tenorio (Stone 2167B) has opposite-simple first leaves as found in A. manningii. Somewhat later I discovered that Orosi seedlings from under the same parental tree may have either opposite-compound (Stone 2333) or opposite-simple leaves (Stone 2553).

This species grows to be a very large tree (up to 90 cm. dbh) in the premontane rainforest between 650-1,200 m. Fertile specimens are recorded only from the vicinity of Rio Platanillo. Oreomunnea pterocarpa, gavilan bianco, is a common associate in this area. Sterile samples of what appear to be the same species, along with Oreomunnea mexicana, have been collected near the headwaters of the Rio Sapo, about 28 km. north-east of the village of Platanillo. Peak flowering occurs in March and April, though the presence of a range of fruit sizes in April as well as August suggests a more prolonged flowering period. Occasion-ally, trees bear only male flowers (Stone 2220, 25 March 1967), but most commonly both sexes are present. These trees appear to be truly bisexual, rather than polygamodioecious as reported by Skutch (in Manning, 1949). The exclusive production of male flowers is encountered in young trees, whereas adults display a great deal of variability in the type of inflorescence that is produced on a particular branch. I suspect also that the same tree shows seasonal and yearly differences in the frequency of production of male and female flowers.</nonMorph>

The new Costa Rican subspecies is distinguished from A. williamsii subsp. williamsii primarily on the basis of the male flower. Subspecies tapantiensis has a well defined, oblong recep-tacle bearing (6)8(9) stamens. Each pair of stamens is subtended by a floral segment (4 total) that forms a partial hood over the tips of the anthers at anthesis. Subspecies williamsii has a more or less elongate receptacle with 6-11 stamens, subtended by 4-7 floral seg-ments that are variable in position and shape; they open flat and do not enfold the stamens at maturity. Because no male flowers have been collected at Monteverde, the assignment of these specimens to subsp. tapantiensis is speculative at this time. Field identification of the species is based on the glabrous leaves, long petiole (on the average somewhat longer in subsp. williamsii than in subsp. tapantiensis, lower leaflets approximating upper leaflets in size, and occasional serrations on the leaflet margins.</nonMorph>
  <nonMorph pid="1.txtp166">A discussion of the close relationship of Alfaroa williamsii to A. costaricensis is included under the latter species. Not surprising perhaps is the discovery of a putative hybrid between these species from Estrella, Cartago Province (Stone 3379: 6 July 1972; 2 January 1973). The tree was sterile, even though it was reasonably large with a 23 cm. dbh and a height of 15 m. The specimen appears intermediate in several respects: the shoots range from glabrous (cf. A. williamsii to moderately pubescent (cf. A. costaricensis); the petioles are of medium-length (ca. 2-3.5 cm.); leaflet number is most commonly 10 (8-14; cf. A. williamsii); the leaflets range from obtuse to truncate at the base (cf. A. costaricensis); the lowermost leaflets may be reduced, but are never less than one-fourth the size of the upper leaflets (cf. A. williamsii). The "Alto de la Estrella" was visited by Standley in 1924 at a time when A. costaricensis was a common tree of the "wet forest" (Standley 39122, 39217. The putative hybrid was located on cut-over land on the lower reaches of the mountain. A. williamsii subsp. tapantiensis grows today within 2 km. of Estrella, and both putative parents might still be sym-patric on the upper slopes. Alfaroa costaricensis Standley var. elongata Manning, which was described by Manning (1949) from a single male-flowered collection (Skutch 4685), is probably a hybrid also. Manning had questioned the taxonomic placement of the variety and correctly pointed out that it differs from the species by having glabrous foliage, distinctly petioled leaves, and sessile stamina te flowers with hooded floral segments (cf. A. williamsii ; see Manning, 1949, Figs. 1, 16, 17: Skutch 4685), but does have the truncate leaflet bases as in A. costaricensis. In contrast to Stone 3379, specimens from this tree have a larger number of leaflets (14-18[22]), as in A. costaricensis. If Skutch 4685 is, in fact, a hybrid, the enormous size of the tree (90 m. dbh and 30 m. tall: Skutch, in Manning, 1949) indicates that the hybridization occurred when the forest was virgin. Attempts to relocate "elongata" at Vera Blanca have not been successful. A. williamsii has not been collected in this area, although A. costaricensis is still fairly com-mon in the open pastures at 1700 m. elevation. This is the first report of hybridization in Alfaroa.</nonMorph>

Oreomunnea (de Candolle, 1862, 1864, 1914; Standley, 1927a; Manning, 1959; Jacobs, 1960).

O. pterocarpa is apparently endemic to the Rio Reventazon Valley and its tributaries, although there is one unconfirmed report of O. pterocarpa from Laguna Hule in Alajuela Province (see Stone, 1972). O. mexicana, which occurs in scattered sites at higher elevations in Cartago Province, grows as far west as the Pan American Highway, extending into San Jose Province. Surprisingly, there are no reports of this species occurring between Jinotega, Nicaragua, and Cartago, Costa Rica, a distance of about 650 km. Fruiting material of both species is distinctive because of the 3-winged bract. Sterile trees are less easily iden-tified, though the exfoliating platelets of bark found in O. mexicana are not common in tropical forests. As in Alfaroa, seedlings and saplings of the understory give the best clues. O. mexicana has pinnately compound leaves, alternate at first, later opposite, and leaflets that are coarsely serrate and vivid pink when first un-folding. Seedlings and saplings of O. pterocarpa are less distinctive. However, the leaves are glaucous below, often hairy on the petiole base, alternate-simple-entire in the early stages, becoming opposite-compound with entire leaflets.</nonMorph>

As presently defined, Oreomun-nea mexicana subsp. mexicana is known from Mexico, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. O. mexicana subsp. costaricensis has been reported only from Costa Rica, although the Boquette area in Chiriqui Pro-vince, Panama, is a promising locality for future investigation. This subspecies ranges from 1100 to 1860 m. (Stone 3620) in the pro-vinces of Cartago and San Jose. Trees from the virgin forests above Tapanti and El Muneco are situated on fog-shrouded ridges. A few trees are still standing on the steep, hillside pastures above the Pan American Highway just south and west of the city of Cartago (Stone 3632). This subspecies is often sympatric with Alfaroa williamsii subsp. tapantiensis and is occasionally associated with A. costaricensis (Tapanti, Cartago) and A manningii (Valle Escon-dido, Cartago). Field identification is relatively simple. Seedlings and young saplings have odd-pinnate leaves that are at first alter-nate, later opposite. The new leaves are pale to vivid pink, and the narrow leaflets are numerous (18-20) and coarsely serrate. Shoots from saplings can be confused with A. costaricensis. However, the petiole and rachis of O. mexicana are puberulent, rather than pubes-cent, tiny auricles may be evident; and, particularly, the upper leaf-let surface is light green and the lower one almost silvery, rather than dull green. Large trees show a flush of new leaves in March- June, August, and again in November. The new leaves on older trees are more of a yellowish-red than the vivid pink shoots of its saplings or trees of Alfaroa, but, most distinctively, large, reddish-brown platelets of bark exfoliate from the larger trunks (over 45 cm.). Smaller trees have relatively smooth bark on the lower trunk and evidence of incipient exfoliation in the vicinity of the first major branches. Flowering occurs with a flush of new growth; records are available for 29 April (Stone 2177B), 1 June (Stone 3287), and 29 August (Stone 2680). The only record of fruiting material of this species in Costa Rica was made on 1 March (Stone 3632), though young seedlings with the cotyledons still attached have been collect-ed on 20 January (Stone 2335), 29 April (Stone 2177A), 8 June (Stone 2746), and 13 November (Stone 271 8A ).</nonMorph>
  <nonMorph pid="1.txtp177">The two subspecies of Oreomunnea mexicana that are recognized (Stone, 1972) apparently cannot be separated on the basis of vegeta-tive characters, and even the diagnostic floral differences are subtle. The Costa Rican subspecies has female flowers that are sessile, or nearly so, and oriented away from the floral axis (45 angle), and the sepal lobes are spread at anthesis. Subspecies mexicana has female flowers with conspicuous pedicels to 3 mm. long, the bract-bract-eolar cup is somewhat recurved so that the flower is oriented more or less parallel to the axis of the catkin, and the sepal lobes are incurved to form a chamber around the stigma at pollination. The mature fruits are also very similar: those of subsp. costaricensis are sessile or have pedicels reaching a maximum of 2 mm. and the sepals, enclosed by the bracteolar lobe, are spread; the pedicels of subsp. mexicana commonly range to 3 or 4 mm. and the sepals arch over the stigma. This species is quite different from the only other member of the genus, O. pterocarpa. In some respects O. mexicana combines certain vegetative features of Alfaroa costaricensis (i.e., serrate leaflets) with floral features characteristic of Engelhardia roxburghiana (floral morphology).</nonMorph>

  <nonMorph pid="1.txtp180">Gavilan bianco, as it is known locally in the Plantillo area, is endemic to the Atlantic watershed of Costa Rica, occurring along tributaries flowing into the Rio Reventazon in Cartago Province (Pittier, 1957). The tree has been reported to range from 200 to 1500 m. elevation. Herbarium vouchers, however, only verify collec-tions between 550 and 820 m., although a cultivated tree in the Botanic Garden of the Universidad de Costa Rica in San Jose (1168 m. ) is healthy and producing flowers, fruits, and viable seeds. This species is sympatric with Alfaroa manningii. Trees of the rainforest around Platanillo and Tuis commonly have plank buttresses extend-ing to 2.5 m. in diameter at the base. The bark is tight, often gray and the leaves are dark green above. The lower leaflet surface, rachis, petiole, and stems of new growth are glaucous. Flushes of new growth are usually vivid pink. Flowering overlaps with fruit maturation. Male and/or female flowers are recorded for the months of January (Stone 1346), March (Stone 1346), April (Leon 1523), and September (Leon 1819), while mature fruits are present in January (Stone 1016, Stone 1346), March (Stone 2222), April (Leon 1523, Tonduz 18000), and July (Lankester, Stevens 468a, Stork 2808).</nonMorph>

Modern phylogenists have considered this family related to the Chenopodiaceae (Centro-spermae or Gary ophy Hales) but Batis lacks betacyanins and betaxanthins (T. J. Mabry and B. L. Turner, Taxon 13:197-200. 1964), which suggests that they are not related to the Centro-spermae. More recently the detection of "Myrosinase" in extracts of Batis maritima has suggested a relationship with the Cappari-dales (Schraudolf, Schmidt, &amp; Weberling in Experientia 27:1090- 1091. 1971).

  <nonMorph pid="1.txtp285">The oaks (Quercus spp.) are not represented by many species in Costa Rica, but they are often a dominant group in our highland forests, achieving both great individual size and great numbers. They form large stands in the Cordillera de Talamanca above 2500 m. elevation and occasionally at lower elevations on some of the slopes of the Pacific watershed. Only one species (Q. oleoides) is found below 500 m. elevation, while several occur above 3000 m. (Q. costaricensis, Q. copeyensis, and Q. seemannii). Our knowledge of these trees is still poor as their size makes collecting difficult and the populations are poorly sampled. The hard wood has had many uses, but it is especially prized for making charcoal in Costa Rica. The production of charcoal has caused the destruction of many oak forests containing large trees.</nonMorph>

Species of the subgenus Quercus (formerly called subgenus Lepidobalanus) are often referred to as white oaks because of the pale color of their bark and branchlets. Species of subgenus Erythrobalanus are endemic to North and Central Amer-ica and are referred to as black oaks because of their dark bark and branchlets. The two full-page figures illustrate the Costa Rican species of the two subgenera. The following dichotomy outlines the major differences between the two subgenera, but the distinctions are often difficult to see in herbarium specimens.

  <nonMorph pid="1.txtp292">Dr. Cornelius Muller has recently mentioned (pers. comm.) his intention of reviewing the oaks of Costa Rica. At present, his view of the Costa Rican species differs from the one presented here in the following ways. Dr. Muller believes that Q. gulielmi-treleasei and Q. rapurahuensis are not distinguishable from Q. seemannii. He also believes that what are here called Q. insignis and Q. pilarius are both elements of Q. oocarpa. Dr. Muller interprets Q. tonduzii as a local population of Q. eugeniaefolia. He also recognizes Q. panamandinea and an undescribed species. Thus, Dr. Muller finds ten species of Quercus in Costa Rica, of which eight represent the twelve species recognized in the treatment given here. The student of Costa Rica's flora should not be disturbed by these differences in interpretation. As mentioned, the oaks are notorious for their ability to hybridize, and they produce populations of considerable variability. Also, these large trees have been poorly sampled, and mature fruit are rare in collections. These factors contribute to differing species-concepts in the work of different authors.

The type collection of Q. seibertii (Seibert 225 from Chiriqui) has unusually broad and entire leaves that are subcordate at the base. A review of our recent collections leads me to believe that this is only an unusual leaf-form and not specifically distinct. The type of Q. davidsoniae Standley (Davidson 864 from Chiriqui) has charac-teristics of both Q. insignis and Q. oocarpa, and I believe that it is either a hybrid or a backcross between the two.

There are two type sheets of Tonduz 11795 at the U.S. National Herbarium, and I suspect that they represent a mixed collection. I take sheet 930372 to be the type, as illustrated by Trelease, and sheet 93067 to be a specimen of Q. see-mannii. Outside of our flora, Q. rapurahuensis is most closely re-lated to Q. benthamii A. DC. of Guatemala, which differs in the longer and narrower buds and the secondary veins arising more acutely from the midvein. The wood is said to be good for firewood but not for lumber.</nonMorph>

  <nonMorph pid="1.txtp368">Quercus seemannii is a species of considerable but not unusual variability. It is characterized by its small acorns, generally small lustrous leaves often acute at both apex and base, and its glabre-scent parts. This species probably intergrades with Q. gulielmi-treleasei, and it may hybridize with Q. rapurahuensis and Q. ton-duzii. These species may be difficult to separate in the absence of acorns and comparative material. Quercus seemannii and its close relatives in Costa Rica are, in turn, related to the entire-leaved black oaks (subgenus Erythrobalanus) of middle and northern Central America. These species together make up the most difficult com-plex in Central America's oaks. Though many names and distinc-tions have been proposed to separate them, I believe that no adequate treatment of these plants is presently available and that they are in need of careful study in the field. The following com-ments deal with a few names applicable to this group that have been in use in Costa Rica and Panama.</nonMorph>
  <nonMorph pid="1.txtp369">The name Q. sapotaefolia has been used for oaks of this species with small oblong leaves blunt at the apex. This type of leaf-form is very rare in Costa Rica (Lems 630714, Opler 147, Pittier 2036), and it can occasionally be found together with aristate leaf-tips on the same branchlet (A. Jimenez 2782, Lent 774, Williams &amp; Molina 13851 ). These are merely variants in Q. seemannii of Costa Rica and I am sure that the name sapotaefolia does not apply. Liebmann describes the tvpe (Skinner in herb. Hooker) as being from Guate-mala, not Costa Rica (Trelease 1924, Muller 1941), and I am sure that he is correct. The holotype sheet of Q. panamandinaea ( Wood-son &amp; Schery 360 in MO) possesses foliated stems that match per-fectly with some material that I have included under Q. seemannii. The acorns associated with the specimen, but detached, appear to be those of Q. corrugata though not quite mature. I believe this name is based on a mixed collection. Type material of Q. citrifolia (Oersted 3461, 3 sheets in C) has distinctly petiolate laminae abruptly narrowed at the base. I had at first thought that this was the same as Q. rapurahuensis but examination of the type material leads me to believe that it represents only an unusual form of Q. seemannii.</nonMorph>
  <nonMorph pid="1.txtp370">I prefer to use the name Q. seemannii because of the excellent illustration presented by Liebmann and Oersted in Chenes de 1'Amerique Tropicale (plate 20) and presence of type material in the Hookerian herbarium at Kew (fide Trelease 1924). Type material of Q. eugeniaefolia, said to have been at Berlin, is probably destroyed.</nonMorph>

  <nonMorph pid="1.txtp640">Cecropia, containing perhaps as many as 60 species, is one of the most characteristic genera of the American tropics. Some species are common in secondary growth, and their tall, few-branched habit with very large umbrella-like leaves produces a striking silhouette. Other species are found in mature forests and may reach 30 m. in height. The aggressive biting ants that are often present in these trees have apparently deterred botanical collectors, so that these common plants are poorly represented in herbaria and their species are very poorly understood. Knowledge of both male and female flowering parts is necessary for the effective delimitation of species. These plants are commonly called guarumo in Central America.</nonMorph>

The description of the male spikes of this species (under C. eximia in the "Flora of Panama" (Woodson, Ann. Missouri Bot.

  <nonMorph pid="1.txtp730">Dorstenia choconiana is easily recognized among our species be-cause of its leaves borne at intervals along the elongated stem. This species is unusual in having two definite kinds of leaves that are never found on the same plant and with very few plants having inter-mediate kinds of leaves. Both forms (or varieties) can be found in a large population, but one usually greatly outnumbers the other. The plants with deeply pinnately lobed leaves can be referred to as variety choconiana, and those with almost entire oblong leaves, often with long acuminate apices, can be referred to as variety in-tegrifolia Donn.-Smith. The plants with deeply lobed leaves are not as common as those with entire leaves in Costa Rica, on the basis of our present sampling of the species.</nonMorph>

Several varieties have been proposed, but these seem to be no more than unusual leaf-forms that are usually consistent for an indivi-dual plant but not for a population.

  <nonMorph pid="1.txtp743">A genus of several hundred species found throughout the tropics but especially diverse in southeast Asia. Ficus is a very distinctive genus with one of the most unusual inflorescences and pollinating mechanisms in the plant world. The flowers and fruit enclosed by a fleshy receptacle require that pollen enter the ostiole through a barrier of overlapping scales. Only the small fig-wasps, chalcid wasps of the family Agaonidae, can effect pollination in Ficus and these wasps can only develop within the fig. The wasps have developed unusual morphology and behavior patterns to carry on pollination, and the different species of Ficus are pollina-ted by different and specific species of wasps (see Ramirez, Evolu-tion, 24:680-691. 1970). The developmental phases of the fig (syconium) have been divided by Galil and Eiskowitch (in New Phytol. 67:745-758. 1968) as follows: Phase A, the prefemale, or the immature fig prior to opening of the ostiole. Phase B, the female, as the ostiolar scales loosen, female flowers ripen, wasps enter the fig and oviposit into the ovaries. Phase C, interfloral, as the wasp larvae and seed embryos develop within the fig and the ovaries occupied by larvae become galls. Phase D, the male, as male flowers mature and the wasps reach adulthood, mate, and the female wasps leave the fig. Phase E, post-floral, as the fig becomes more succulent and the seeds ripen to the point where they are ready for dispersal.</nonMorph>

Ficus werckleana differs only slightly in its larger, more blunt leaves and larger stipules, but the mature fruit appear to be much smaller. Ficus yoponensis is also closely related but seems to be more com-mon in wetter regions and at higher altitudes and the smaller leaves have more secondary veins. While the above are all closely related, it is interesting that no definite intermediates are known to me, but we do have several collections (Burger &amp; Ramirez 4119, Guana-caste, and Croat 12695, Canal Zone) that appear to represent hy-brids with F. maxima.

While a few species are common as weeds or found in the cracks of city pavement (P. microphylla), most species are confined to the shaded floor of moist forests or to the proximity of streams and brooks.</nonMorph>

  <nonMorph pid="1.txtp1499">Pilea imparifolia is recognized by the climbing habit, leaves of a node very different in size, unequal oblique base of the large lami-nae, pinnate or subpalmate venation, glabrous parts, and very small inflorescences. The very small size of flowers and inflorescences has resulted in very few fertile collections (Lent 434, 1590, &amp;2811 ). This species is closely related to P. pansamalana Bonn. -Smith of Guate-mala, but that species has longer and narrower large leaves with dis-tinctly palmate (triplinerved) venation. Pilea tilarana of the Sierra de Tilaran and adjacent areas is a terrestrial with very different fruit but rather similar aspect vegetatively. Our material of P. im-parifolia differs from South American material in the shorter appen-dages on the male perianth-parts (0.2 mm.) and somewhat different lamina-form. However, the form of the leaves varies greatly in this and related species, even on the same plant.</nonMorph>

Pilea tilarana is generally of smaller stature than either of those species and possesses much larger fruit.

The present interpretation and circumscription of U. elata is very tentative, and the name may not apply to our material. This species was originally described from Jamaican material, and C.D. Adams (Flowering Plants of Jamaica 237. 1972) states that the species is endemic to Jamaica.

  <nonMorph pid="1.txtp1599">A genus of about 30 species found primarily in temperate regions and on high mountains in the tropics. The genus is represented by a single species in Costa Rica, but other species have been introduced and will continue to be introduced as weeds. However, these have apparently not persisted or spread extensively. The stinging hairs facilitate recognition of the genus. The common Spanish name "ortiga" or "hortiga" is a direct derivative of the Latin urtica.</nonMorph>

  <nonMorph pid="1.txtp1603">Urtica leptophylla is recognized by the stinging hairs, opposite conspicuously serrate leaves, spike-like inflorescences, and unusual stipules united ( interpetiolar) for more than half their length and often quite broad. This species is closely related to U. magellanica Juss. ex Poir., but the latter has larger fruit and ranges no further north than Peru. This species resembles U. mexicana Liebm. but that species has separate stipules. Despite the name of one of the synonyms, this species has never been recorded from Nicaragua; the name referred to a small town on Volcan Irazu.</nonMorph>

In-florescences fasciculate in the leaf axils, flower clusters about 8 mm. long and usual-ly subtended by the 4 persisting stipules; male flowers sessile or pedicellate, peri-anth about 2.5 mm. long, including a narrow subapical projection 1-1.5 mm. long, filaments about 2 mm. long, anther 1 mm. long; female flowers about 1 mm. long with a central longitudinal groove and 2 short stigmas. Fruit sessile in the axils of lower leaves, 1-2 mm. long, 2- or 3-angled, stigmas apparently persisting, locules usually 2 (3), the fruit very tightly enclosed within the (apparent) perianth-tube.</nonMorph>
  <nonMorph pid="1.txtp1606">Plants of the very wet Caribbean slopes of Central Costa Rica between 1000 and 1500 m. elevation; apparently flowering through-out the year. This species is known only from the Rio Claro (Rio Hondura drainage) below La Palma (Burger et al. 4137, 6270, &amp; 7651) in the province of San Jose and above Cachi (Lent 1607) in Cartago Province.</nonMorph>
  <nonMorph pid="1.txtp1607">This species is recognized by the opposite leaves subtending small clusters of flowers, the usually four persisting stipules at each leafy node, the 4-parted male flowers with projections on the perianth-parts, the 2- or 3-angled fruit tightly enclosed within a perianth-tube that is unlobed apically and the presence of usually two locules, each with a seed. The latter condition violates a basic char-acter of the Urticaceae: an ovary with a single locule containing a single ovule. I believe the present situation may be attributable to the growing together of two female flowers. The longitudinal groove favors this interpretation. Because the stigmatic areas of these flowers are so small, it may be that the fruit develop without pol-lination.</nonMorph>
  <nonMorph pid="1.txtp1608">The unusual fruit and opposite leaves make it difficult to place these plants. Because they have the four separate stipules and sessile clusters of flowers, I believe that these plants are closely allied to the genus Boehmeria.</nonMorph>
